    "So far, you've learned very important fundamental concepts in Machine Learning such as supervised learning (e.g. classification and regression) vs unsupervised learning (e.g. clustering), overfitting, model evaluation, and performance measures (accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, MSE, etc.). You've learned that two of the most common approaches in supervised learning are regression and classification. In this assignment, you are going to practice what you've learned so far by building ML models and applying them on data.\n",

    "<b>Very Important Note:</b> Read ALL the instructions in this notebook very carefully. **Wherever the documentation link is provided, click on the links and read the documentation!** Careless reading and skipping instructions are major sources of making mistakes and losing points in your assignments. Also note that this assignment has three parts and includes multiple steps and questions. You're strongly recommended to get started early and plan to finish well before the due date. Technical problems or other issues/questions on the due date or just a day before would NOT be accepted as an excuse for extension."

    "<b>Course Policy Reminder</b>\n",
    "Debugging the codes and error resolution are ALWAYS the students' responsbility regardless of the source or the cause of the error. This policy will be enforced in email communications and the office hours. Keep in mind that all assignments are individual graded tasks. Any collaboration with other students is strictly prohibited and is considered as cheating. Students should NOT share any answer, solution, or code with other students. Violations of these policies would be penalized according to UMBC academic integrity policy.\n",

    "**You must run ALL cells** and get the correct outputs for all cells and give complete answers to all questions. **Cells/codes with no output get zero!**\n",

    "\n",
    "Wherever needed, you should replace `...` elipsis with your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "`...` may indicate one or more lines of missing codes. Some outputs are provided to you to use as reference and to verify that your output is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing Effect on Grade**: Preprocessing steps are so critical in each part and you should pay special attention to make sure that you do all preprocessing steps correctly. That is why the reference outputs have been provided in preprocessing steps. Your notebook would become ineligible for grading implementation parts if you have wrong results/outputs of preprocessing, so be extremely careful with all preprocessing steps. "

    "(a) \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of balanced accuracy xgb seems to come out ever so slightly ahead compared to random forest with a score of .523 vs .506. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the imbalanced data the weighted avg in the classification report isn't a good metric to look at as the class with the much larger number of entries will have a bigger weight and overpower the weight for the class with fewer samples. looking at the macro averages of the classification report which isn't weighted, shows the xgb model has a precision, recall, and f1 score of .58, .52, and .53, respectively. where as the rf model has a precision, recall, and f1 score of .73, .51, .50, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "The precision and recall scores function show the xgb model has a precision and recall of 0.2, and 0.058, respectively. and the rf model has a precision and recall of .5, and .014, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "How you use all these scores to determine the performance of the model depends on the context of the problem you're trying to solve. In our case, we are trying to predict if class is a stroke or not a stroke. With this context in mind, we could argue that this model could be used in a medical diagnostic setting. In this setting we would want as little false negatives as possible, as it is very undesirable in a medical diagnostic context. To achieve this we would want a higher recall, because the higher the recall the lower the number of false negatives there are. The xbg model has a higher recall so in this context the xgb model will most likely perform better than the rf model. Also the high precision score of the rf model gives the opposite effect that we are looking for, due to the precision and recall trade off. the higher the precision the lower the recall and vise versa. In the medical diagnostic context, we want a high recall so the rf model having a higher precision of .5 has the opposite effect of what we want, making the model have a higher chance at producing a higher number of false negatives compared to the xgb model. This is reflected when we print the number of tp, tn, fp, fn from the confusion matrix. and you can see that the rf model has a higher amount of false negatives than the xgb model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if you wanted your model to produce as little false positives as possible then the random forest model would suit your needs better as the higher percision of .5 of that model will give you a lower amount of false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your needs called for more of a balance between both recall and precision then the f1 score would be a better metric to look at. In our case the xgb model ended up having a higher f1 score of .09 compared to rf models's .03 for our positive class 1. and xgb's macro avg was also higher by 3. So according the f1 score, the xgb model would likely perform slightly better than the rf model.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the imbalanced nature of the data set accuracy isn't the besst metric to use, Balanced accuracy trys to account for that and in this case xgb seems to come out slightly ahead so if you were to use balanced accuracy as your performance measure the xgb may have the better model performance.   \n",
    "\n",
    "(b)  \n",
    "\n",
    "No accuracy is not a good indicator due to the imbalanced data, because of this it not the best performance measure to evaluate these two models with. \n",
    "\n",
    "From our preprossesing stage we know we have a lot of negative samples and very few positive samples. when the data is skewed like this its easy for the larger number of negative data points to over power the lesser positive data points and make accuracy appear to be higher then it is. say we have 10,000 negative points and 1,000 positive, If The model predicted all of the points being negative the accuracy will be 90% but the model would have predicted all the positive cases wrongly. And would not be a good metric it telling us how well our model performs when predicting positive cases. So accuracy in a imbalanced data set can be deceiving.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest thing that would help is adding more positive stroke data samples to balance out the data. also If we are using this model in a medical diagnostic context to diagnose strokes then I would try to adjust hyper parameters to try to increase recall, since high recall helps lower the amount of false negatives, as false negatives are very undesirable in a medical diagnostic context. We could use hyperparameter optimization algorithms like grid search to help us with this. We could also possibly try other types of models if they exist, that may perform better on imbalanced data sets than rf or xbg would."

    "- **Q4** [2 points]- Check the `best_rf` performance scores and explain whether or not fine-tuning hyperparameters using `GridSearch` helped resolve the performance issues with this imablanced dataset. Explain why COMPLETELY. You must justify your answer and make arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER: \n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning the random forest hyperparmeters using grid search seemed to indeed help in slightly improving the performance in  certain aspects. \n",
    "Its precision score has been lowered and its not as high as before, and its recall score has been slighly increased as well, meaning that grid search managed to slighly balanced out the precision/recall scores so that the model is not as heavy on the precision as before. This can be further seen in the confusion matrix where there is now less false negatives and more false positives that were predicted due to the increase recall and the lowering of the precision.\n",
    "What this means is that the fine-tuned model is a bit more useful in other use cases, other than highly favoring the minimization of false positives that the original unoptimized rf model had with its higher precision and lower recall.\n",
    "This optimized model will likely perform a bit better than the original, In use cases where your not as worried about eliminating and minimizing possible false positives predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The balanced accuracy has also increased from the original model with a balanced accuracy of 0.520. which is more in line with the balance accuracy of the xgb model.\n"

    "\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC stands for area under the curve. Even without seeing the AUC scores it is easy to see visually which curve has more area under it in the gragh. Essentially the higher and closer the curve is to the top left corner of the graph the more area it has. we can see the AUC_RF curve being higher and closer to the top left corner than the xgb curve. Meaning the AUC score of the rf model is higher than the xgb model."

    "Based on the ROC curve and AUC scores, The rf is better performing with a AUC of .81 meaning a 81% chance that the model will be able to distinguish between positive class and negative class. While the xgb model has a AUC score 0f .77. ROC curves are useful in comparing different models on the same problem, and visualizing the performance of the models. According to the graphs our models seem to perform fairly well. But our data set is very imbalanced and while its was able to predict many negative samples correctly, it didn't do to well at predicting positive cases correctly. Maybe the ROC curves and AUC scores can be some what misleading for large imbalances in the data, and the curves maybe some what optimistic in making the model look like its performing better than it could be due to the imbalanced data set.
